- look into :multi_valued, what it actually does / does not do
  - multi_valued fields are not sortable
  - we could auto guess it based off the association type
  - if its not a multivalued field and we index many values what happens
    to the rest, ignored? replace the previous? ???
- wrap all db transactions in a solr transaction
- make it safe to wrap solr transactions in other solr transactions
  - would it be smart (once this works) to wrap all auto_solr_nnnn methods
    in a transaction?
- write tests
